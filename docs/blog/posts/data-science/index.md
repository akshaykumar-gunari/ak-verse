Welcome to the Data Science section of AK-Sphere!

> The best way to predict the future is to invent it. -- _Alan Kay (A great reminder for innovators in AI and ML.)_

> Artificial intelligence is the new electricity. – _Andrew Ng (Highlighting the transformative power of AI across industries.)_

I think these quotes are enough to find a valid reason to deep dive into the world of Data Science. From powering AI and automating processes to enhancing customer experiences and driving business success, Data Science is a versatile and in-demand field that opens doors to countless opportunities.
